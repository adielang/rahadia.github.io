# Hi, I'm Adi Rahadi
I started my career as a web developer. I was very good at the details of the software programs and throughout the years, I became curious about how software was created and why some products were hard to use while others were intuitive. 

I'm passionate about building beatiful and user-centric products for the web as well as mobile app. I am a lifelong learner who loves to teach.

I'm currently looking for work that utilizes my expertise and industry knowledge
